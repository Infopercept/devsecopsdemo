# ðŸ“™ Running serveless workloads on Kubernetes

## KNATIVE

Knative (pronounced "kay-nay-tiv") is an open-source platform that provides a set of building blocks for deploying and managing serverless and container-based workloads on Kubernetes. It enables developers to focus on writing code, rather than managing infrastructure, by providing a set of abstractions for common tasks such as scaling, routing, and monitoring.

Knative is designed to work with Kubernetes, a popular open-source container orchestration system. It extends Kubernetes by adding a set of custom resources, controllers, and APIs that make it easier to deploy and manage serverless workloads.

Knative provides the following components:

- Serving: a component that enables you to deploy and manage your serverless functions and applications. It automatically scales your workloads based on traffic and provides automatic routing and SSL termination.
- Eventing: a component that enables you to easily create and manage event-driven architectures. It provides a set of abstractions for working with events, such as channels, triggers, and brokers.
- Build: a component that enables you to build and deploy container images in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides a set of abstractions for building and deploying container images, such as build templates and build triggers.

Knative is a relatively new project, but it's gaining traction quickly because of its simplicity and ease of use. It is supported by major cloud providers such as Google, Red Hat, and IBM, and has a growing community of contributors and users.
